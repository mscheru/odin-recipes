<h3>The Finished Product: One Pot Spaghetti</h3>

<p>
  Spaghetti is one of those meals almost everybody 
  eats, but no two people make it exactly the same. 
  From traditional Italian sauces made from 
  fresh-picked tomatoes slowly simmered for two days, 
  to Southern sauces made with a pinch of white sugar 
  that can be whipped up in 30 minutes, spaghetti 
  recipes are as diverse as the folks who make them.
